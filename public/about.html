<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Parismita Das. I am learning web development and this is my first portfolio project using only HTML.
   I enjoy building web pages and exploring how websites work. </p>

<p>My current skills include writing clean HTML code and creating structured web pages.
  I am excited to continue learning more about CSS and Javascript in the next steps
  of my journey.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, learning new things and solving problems.
  My goal is to grow as a web developer and build creative, user-friendly websites
  in the future.</p>
